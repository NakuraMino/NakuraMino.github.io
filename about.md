Hi! I’m Mino, and I like working on cool things with cool people. I’m currently interning at X, the Moonshot Factory.

I’m a B.S./M.S. student at the University of Washington and work as a research assistant at the Robotics and State Estimation Lab under Chris Xie. In the past, I have worked as a SWE intern at Microsoft and Carnegie Robotics and as a research assistant at the Human-Centered Robotics Lab under Mike Chung. Sometimes I also help teach computer science courses.
