Hi, I’m Mino. I like working on cool things with cool people. I’m currently working as a Software Engineer at [Starfish Space](https://www.starfishspace.com/).

I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S./M.S degree in Computer Science. I have had the pleasure of working as a Research Assistant under [Chris Xie](https://chrisdxie.github.io/) and [Michael Jae-Yoon Chung](https://mjyc.github.io/). In the past, I also interned at [Google X](https://x.company/) ([Everyday Robots](https://everydayrobots.com/)), [Carnegie Robotics](https://www.carnegierobotics.com/), and Microsoft.
